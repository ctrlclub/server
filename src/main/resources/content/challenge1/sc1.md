For the last challenge, you may have used a loop!
It's much easier to use the `sum` function, for example:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print(sum(numbers)) # this will print 6
```
**Internally**, this will sum the lists using a for-loop - it's just a convenient shorthand.

Wow! That's a lot of PS5's. Next, your manager wants to check how the factory performed **on average**. She'd like you to calculate the **mean value** across the entire year.

*(round the answer **down** to the nearest integer)*

::: hint
The mean is the `sum / number of items`
You can use `len(list)` to get the length of the list
