If you've just come from the `Basics: For-Loops` challenge, don't say I didn't warn you - there will be **A LOT** of for-loops.

You're working at the PS5 factory - it's the end of the year and your manager hands you a report showing **how many** PS5's were produced **each day**:

```python+copy
%list%
```

Your manager wants you to analyse this data - just to grab a few quick stats from the numbers she's provided.

To start off, she's asked you to calculate the **total number** of PS5's produced this year - sum the list.
