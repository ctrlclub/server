Finally, to understand how stable production was, your manager asks for the **max delta** - the difference between the highest and lowest daily outputs.
To do this, try subtract the highest value from the lowest value.

::: hint
Try use the `max` and `min` functions.
```python
numbers = [1, 9, 4, -5]
print(max(numbers)) # this will print 9
```
