Great job!

Now, I don't like `HTTPCode.UNAUTHORIZED` requests - why are my website users trying to access pages they shouldn't?

I want to **ban all IPs** that have made an `HTTPCode.UNAUTHORIZED` request.

Loop through the dictionary you made in **Part 2**, and **identify the number of IPs we should be banning**.
