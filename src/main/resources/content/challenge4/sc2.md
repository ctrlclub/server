Wow! %lastanswer%??!! That's loads of water.

The scientists are concerned with the volume of water there, and want to know how much more it can hold.

## Part 2 â€” Floodplain Capacity

As said before, each cell in the floodplain can hold up to **100 units of water**.

Using your answer from **Part 1**, and the size of your **floodplain dataset**, calculate how many more units of water can be held.

::: hint

First, multiply the width and height of your dataset. This calculates your total number of cells.

`num_cells * 100` is the total water capacity.

:::

Use your dataset from **Part 1**.
