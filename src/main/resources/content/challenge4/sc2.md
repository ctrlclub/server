Phew... it doesn't seem too flooded yet.

### Part 3 - The Median

To help the scientists analyse the floodplain further, they've asked for the **median** flood height. 

To start, I'd recommend you **flatten** the 2D array (merge all values into one big 1D array).
From there you can sort the array, and find the median value.

Good luck! :)
