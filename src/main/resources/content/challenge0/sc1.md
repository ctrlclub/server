For the last challenge, you may have used a loop!
It's much easier to use the `sum` function, for example:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print(sum(numbers)) # this will print 6
```

The manager doesn't seem satisfied. She's worried production levels aren't consistent across days... To help her do further analysis she wants you to calculate the mean production level.

::: hint
The mean is the `sum / number of items`
You can use len(your_list_here) to get the length of the list
