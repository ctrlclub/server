## Bank.AI is in trouble...
After a recent audit, it has been found that Bank.AI has been **unable to keep track of their money** for **several reasons**.
- Their transfer system is flawed, and the incorrect amount of money is sent
- Their interest system does not work whatsoever
- Their code does not output the balance of some users correctly

Your task is now to **fix their code** so that it works correctly. Using your **now-working** code from **Part 1** , see if you can fix the issues.
**Report to your teammates** when you find problems, so they can update their code too!

Like **Part 1**, copy and paste the output of the code **once it is working as intended**.
*The output will squish into one line in the answer box - that's okay.*

::: hint
Think about what happens when you transfer money. You lose x amount, the other person gains x amount. Is this what the code is doing?
:::

::: hint
The code is performing the correct maths, but the bank dictionary is unaffected. You need to include some code that will update the balance of each account.

::: hint
Why is the first print statement the only one that doesn't work? See if you can spot the missing letter.
